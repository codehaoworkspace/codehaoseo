# How do you calculate asphalt in tons?

Calculating asphalt in tons involves a few simple steps. Here's how you can do it:

Measure the Area: Determine the length, width, and depth of the area where the asphalt will be applied. Make sure all measurements are in the same unit (e.g., feet or meters).

Calculate Volume: Multiply the length by the width by the depth to get the volume in cubic feet or cubic meters.

Convert to Tons: Asphalt is typically sold by weight (tons). To convert volume to tons, you’ll need to know the density of asphalt, which is usually around 145 pounds per cubic foot (or 2.3 tons per cubic meter). Multiply the volume by the density to get the weight in tons.

Example:
If your project area is 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 0.5 feet deep:

Volume = 20 ft × 10 ft × 0.5 ft = 100 cubic feet.

Weight = 100 cubic feet × 145 lbs/cubic foot = 14,500 lbs (or 7.25 tons).

If you want to skip the manual calculations and get accurate results instantly, you can use the [Asphalt Calculator](https://asphalt-calculator.online/). It’s a free online tool that automatically calculates the amount of asphalt needed in tons based on your project dimensions. Just input the length, width, and depth, and it will provide the exact quantity, along with an estimated cost. It’s perfect for homeowners, contractors, and engineers alike!
